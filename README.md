# VectorDrawing
My simple little program that draws vectors.
I made it after Ken Silverman, developer of the Build Engine, recommended I research and work with Vectors, especially dot and cross products, which I'm still learning, before I get into OpenGL again. This program on the surface will is simply drawing cubes yes? Well under the hood, all the outlines are vectors. Once you look up the simple "a", "b", and "a+b" formula, look at the code
and mess with it, you'll see what I am talking about. There isn't much to do with this program, maybe change the pattern, I don't know. I know most of you are probably my friends reading this, but I recommend you look at the code, ask me questions, I'll explain the best I can.
